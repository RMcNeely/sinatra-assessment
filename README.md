# sinatra-assessment

### Current Layout 
This is the basic outline of a website that I will be publishing (probably via Heroku but maybe via AWS) after I finish Learn fulltime.  This website is a project to keep track of all the local wineries and breweries in one place with a social twist.  Right now the Viticultural area has its own working website but there's nothing that brings them all together with various brewaries.  Inside the repo you'll find the basic layout written in the Sinatra Framework. There are models for users, favorites, locations, and drinks that are all associated to one another.  

### Future Direction 
In the future I would like to expand upon the rankings to create a method for individual users to rate their own favorites in the site directly.  I would also then aggregate the rankings to find the areas "favorite" spots.  The location pages will later include an embedded map and photos perhaps.
